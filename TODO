· Make the queue type modular in sv_queue.
  · Reinstate EQC test for sv_queue.
  
· Measure the CoDel stuff.
  How do we measure this stuff? We add a tracer process and outputs data
  to it. Then we pick up the traces and log it to a file so we can track it later.
  We then output into R and plot the measurement.
