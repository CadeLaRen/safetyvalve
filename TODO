· Why is the codel test failing? This is rather odd. It ends up with timeouts,
  which it shouldn't do. So we have to figure out why it does so⋯

· Carry out some serious performance tests.
· Consider having load measurement *outside* the sv_queue process.
· Add some tracing code for the event tracer, so we can see what is going on :)
