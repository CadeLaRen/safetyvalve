TODO list:


→ Run a series of tests on the code base where we substitute the current queue model
  with a new one.
  OK Fix a thing about timestamps in the model: Enqueueing advances time as well.
    If we don't implement this, we break the specification.
· Run a tab-fix run over all files, so the tab-stop becomes more correct
· Introduce timeouts on the queues.
  Timeout is run when replenishing tokens. This requires a change to the model first,
  where we should calculate, with respect to the current timepoint, what should expire
  and then run a filter on the "queue".
  
  It is especially important to check this when we are running on the new sv_table_ets implementation.
  
· Add support for LIFO queues as well.
  · First, change the model so we can run tests in LIFO order.
  · Then change the code so we can run LIFO
  
· Import the Queue test code from Jobs. The verify queue ordering, it is probably
  easier to just steal the code from jobs and use that code for testing. I already wrote
  it there, so it should be fairly easy to import and use.
  
· Handle overload regulation:
  · Lukas Larsson's hint from Ericsson.
  · Ulf Wiger's points from `jobs' needs to be considered here as well.
